This file contains information on the different data sets used for this study. These are:

- 'SRG': contains information on statistical reporting guidelines for sociology journals mentioned in Clarivate Analytics' Web of Science (2016). More specifically, it contains information on (1) the guidelines to which journals request authors' adherence and (2) guidelines authors are allowed to follow by journals. This data set was created to see how many sociology journals request that authors use the APA manual, and thus, the APA statistical reporting guidelines.
- 'APA': contains all fully APA-reported results as retrieved from the 2014-2016 volumes of ASR, AJS, SQ, CHQ, and JMF by Epskamp & Nuijten's R package statcheck. 'APA' was used to study statistical reporting errors.
- 'AllP': contains all reported p-values as retrieved from the 2014-2016 volumes of ASR, AJS, SQ, CHQ, and JMF by Epskamp & Nuijten's R package statcheck. 'AllP' was used to study publication bias, the 'bump' in p-values, and marginal significance.
- 'Hyp': contains all manually retrieved p-values and reproducible results related to explicitly stated hypotheses. These data were retrieved from the 2014-2016 volumes of ASR, AJS, and SQ and were used to study statistical reporting errors, publication bias, the 'bump' in p-values, and marginal significance.
- inclusion_Hyp: contains information on which articles from the 2014-2016 volumes of ASR, AJS, and SQ were included in 'Hyp'.

Furthermore, there is a .xlsx file which lists all the psychology journals that belong to the APA organization. The purpose of this file was to show that in psychology, more journals will adhere to the APA statistical reporting guidelines than is the case in sociology.
