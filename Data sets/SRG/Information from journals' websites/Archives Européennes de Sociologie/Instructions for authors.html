It is open to sociologically informed contributions from anthropologists, economists, historians, lawyers and political scientists. The journal has a special reputation for comparative and historical sociology but is not limited to these fields. It is methodologically open to qualitative and quantitative research. The journal aims to contribute to the diffusion of sociological research from European countries and to enhance interaction between European and non-European sociology. </p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Submission </strong></p><p>All papers must be submitted using ScholarOne Manuscripts through the Journal’s submission site at: </p><p><a href="https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/eur">https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/eur</a> </p><p>All books for review should be sent to: </p><p>European Journal of Sociology </p><p>Editorial office – Mme Sophie Gudin </p><p>Maison Archéologie et Ethnologie </p><p>21 allée de l’Université </p><p>92023 Nanterre Cedex </p><p>France </p><p>All submissions must conform to the submission guidelines outlined below. Failure to do so may result in the submission being rejected. </p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Submission Requirements </strong></p><p>The Journal publishes only original research articles. Papers that have been previously published elsewhere with the exception of working papers series are not accepted. Authors of articles published in the Journal assign copyright to Cambridge University Press (with certain rights reserved) and you will receive a copyright assignment form on acceptance of your paper. </p><p>Authors are responsible for obtaining permission to reproduce any material in which they do not own copyright, to be used both in print and electronic media, and for ensuring that the appropriate acknowledgements are included in their manuscript.</p><p>All submissions must fall within the remit of the journal, as described at the beginning of this document. </p><p>All manuscripts must meet the submission requirements set out in this document, closely following the instructions in the Style Sheet. </p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Length </strong></p><p>Articles including references, notes, and abstract, should not exceed 12,000 words. A word count should be included on the title page. Manuscripts must be accompanied by an abstract of no more than 150 words. </p><p>Book reviews should be in the range between 1,000 and 4,000 words. Footnotes are limited to references and there is no bibliography at the end. </p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Language Editing </strong></p><p>Submissions are accepted in English, French, and German. Before submitting your manuscript, you should have it edited for language, especially if the language you are writing in is not your first language. </p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>English Language Editing Services </strong></p><p>Authors, particularly those whose first language is not English, may wish to have their English-language manuscripts checked by a native speaker before submission. This is optional, but may help to ensure that the academic content of the paper is fully understood by the editor and any reviewers. We list a number of third-party <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/authors/language-services">services</a> specialising in language editing and / or translation, and suggest that authors contact as appropriate. Please note that the use of any of these services is voluntary, and at the author's own expense. Use of these services does not guarantee that the manuscript will be accepted for publication, nor does it restrict the author to submitting to a Cambridge Core published journal. </p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Peer Review </strong></p><p>After a preliminary assessment by the managing editor, all submitted papers considered as in principle suitable for publication will be reviewed by all editors of the journal. Papers will also be sent to at least one external reviewer. The peer review process is double blind. Submissions are to be anonymized. Decisions on publication are made by the editors in their semi-annual editorial meetings in January and June. Decisions on papers received before October 15th will be made by the editors in January. Decisions on papers received before April 15th will be made in June. Contributors can expect to receive feedback on their paper following the respective meeting.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Proofs </strong></p><p>Proofs will be sent to the first named or corresponding author only. In the case of joint authors, please ensure amendments are returned from this author only. Page proofs will be sent to the author responsible for checking them as a PDF file. Corrected proofs should be returned within three days of receipt. All misprints should be corrected, but the author is asked to refrain from making any other alterations. Such alterations may be disallowed and where they are allowed the author may be held responsible for the cost of making them. </p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Style Sheet </strong></p><p>1. Manuscripts should be clearly typed in one and a half spacing, including text in tables, legends, and references. Manuscripts should have a left-hand margin on at least 25mm/1 inch and a right-hand margin of at least 40mm/1.5 inches. Type size should be no smaller than 12 points. The text should not have more than two levels of titles and subtitles. </p><p>2. Footnotes should be kept to a minimum. They should be numbered consecutively (in superscript) and appear at the bottom of the page. </p><p>3. Referencing should be in accordance with the <i>Chicago Manual of Style</i>. In this system, citations in the text and footnotes list the author’s surname, the year of publication and, if necessary, the page number of the work in parentheses. Eg. (Orloff 1993: 22). </p><p>4. The full list of cited references is then provided alphabetically at the end of the article. References should contain, in the case of books, the names of the authors as they appear on the title page, the year of publication, the full title, the place of publication, and the name of the publisher, and in the case of articles, the name(s) of the author(s), the year of publication, the full title of the article, the name of the journal, the volume and issue numbers, and the page reference: </p><p style="margin-left: 20px;">RATH Eric C., 2004. <i>The Ethos of Noh: Actors and their Art </i>(Cambridge, Harvard University Press). </p><p style="margin-left: 20px;">MARES Isabela, 2001.

Details of all funding sources for the work in question should be given in the ‘Acknowledgements’ section. </p><p>6. The submitted manuscript should be prepared using a Word processing package (saved in .doc or .rtf format). Files <strong>must not </strong>be supplied in PDF format. </p><p>7. To ensure a fair review process, the main document should be anonymous. Authors should not allude to themselves as the authors of their article in any part of the text. This includes citing their own previous work in the references section in such a way that identifies them as the authors of the current work. </p><p>8. The author’s name, institutional affiliation, and full contact details (postal address, phone, and email), acknowledgements, and a word count should be supplied on the title page. </p><p>9. Figures and tables should be kept to a minimum. They must be provided in electronic form; the file name should contain the number of the figure of table (‘Table#’, ‘Figure #’). They should be comprehensible without reading the text, and the source must be cited correctly. </p><p>10. Charges apply for all colour figures that appear in the print version of the journal. At the time of submission, contributors should clearly state whether their figures should appear in colour in the online version only, or whether they should appear in colour online <i>and </i>in the print version. There is no charge for including colour figures in the online version of the Journal but it must be clear that colour is needed to enhance the meaning of the figure, rather than simply being for aesthetic purposes. If you request colour figures in the printed version, you will be contacted by CCC-Rightslink who are acting on our behalf to collect Author Charges. Please follow their instructions in order to avoid any delay in the publication of your article. </p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Open Access Policies </strong><i>European Journal of Sociology </i>offers both Gold and Green Open Access. </p><p>You can choose publish to via Gold OA following acceptance of your article subject to payment of an Article Processing Charge (APC) to Cambridge University Press. </p><p>All authors publishing in the journal have the following rights of re-use: </p><p>All postings shall include a prominent bibliographical reference and statement of copyright ownership. Where possible all postings should include a link to the published article on Cambridge Core. In relation to the posting of the Author’s Original or Submitted Manuscript Under Review, a statement that such version has been accepted for publication and will appear in a revised form subsequent to peer review and / or editorial input by Cambridge University Press and / or the journal’s proprietor, as well as a link to the journal’s site on Cambridge Core, should be included. </p><p>Cambridge does not permit full articles in Accepted Manuscript or Version Of Record form to be posted on Commercial Repositories or Social Media Sites including, but not limited to, Social Science Research Network (‘SSRN’), ResearchGate, Academia.edu, Mendeley or LinkedIn. </p><p>Notwithstanding the assignment of copyright or grant of licence in your article, you retain the following non-transferable rights to deposit versions of your article, (subject to appropriate permission having been cleared for any third-party material):</p><table>
