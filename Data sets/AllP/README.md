*AllP* contains all *p*-values extracted by the R statcheck package (Epskamp and Nuijten 2015) from all articles of the 2014-2016 volumes of *ASR*, *AJS*, *SQ*, *JMF*, and *CHQ*, plus manually added information. Variables created by statcheck are indicated below by a boldfaced variable name. The variables in '*AllP*' are:

7. **Reported.Comparison**: reported comparison of the fully APA-reported result, which can be '=', '<', '>', or 'ns'. 
8. **Raw**: the extracted APA-reported result.
9. Result.Table: contains information on whether an extracted *p*-value was part of a table or not, where '1' = *p*-value was part of a table, and '0'= *p*-value was not part of a table.
10. Reported.Not.Relevant: in the following cases, extracted results which were reported as being p-values were not deemed relevant:
    - an extracted *p*-value was not related to a specific result, but was mentioned in the article to indicate which significance levels were used.
